# SQL---From-Beginner-to-Expert
![](https://www.getsoftwareservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SQL-Training.png)


In this repository, I will be sharing my journey of SQL learning from a novice to advanced. One can use this repository and the resources shared to help yourself in learning SQL and also improve on it. You will not only find my very hand written notes but also different types of exercises and practice material which I have used and anyone can use it to get better with their SQL skills.

I have started my learning of SQL with MySQL. I will keep on updating this repository with the resources and material as I keep on creating them or fininding them.
